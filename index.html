            <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I am Abdulazeez Raheem, from Lagos, Nigeria, currently pursuing a Master’s in Sustainable International Agriculture at the University of Göttingen in Germany. Previously, I earned a Master’s in Animal Science from the University of Agriculture Abeokuta, Nigeria, where my  focus was on sustainable livestock production. With a keen interest in technology, I am enhancing my skills in front-end development through IT classes, having already learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My aim is to integrate technology with sustainable agriculture to develop innovative solutions that boost productivity and sustainability. Passionate about community development, I volunteer with NGOs in Lagos, promoting agricultural education among young farmers. My vision is to leverage technology to create resilient global food systems.</p>

I am particularly interested in developing user-friendly applications and platforms that can empower farmers with real-time data, insights, and tools to optimize their agricultural practices. I strongly believe that Alt School Africa learning platform has neccesary tools to help me achieve this dream of mine. </p>
